# Web Portal for Healthcare Staff

This is a simple PHP-based web portal designed for corporate healthcare personnel. It uses the Bootstrap framework for styling and provides modules for:

- **Shift Management** (`shift.php`)
- **Trainings** (`training.php`)
- **Exams** (`exam.php`)
- **Procedure Documents** (`procedure.php`)

## Usage

Serve the project through a PHP-enabled web server. The entry point is `index.php`.

Example using PHP's built-in server:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser and select a module from the menu.
